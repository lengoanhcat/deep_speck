## check_speck
Terminology:
* Real ciphertext Y = 1
* Fake ciphertext 
The hypotheses for testing different make_train_data() in speck.py
  0. original hypothesis: what he did is to say that there is a diference in the speck outputs when the input is structured and when the input is random
  1. compare speck output with random bitstrings for fake ciphertext
  2a. compare speck output with same inputs going into random function
but for that we have to think about what that random function is
  2b. compare speck output with random inputs going into random function
